# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 2017-01-16

**Today's Progress**: Initial commit of my app.

**Thoughts:** I need to confess to you: I'm not a rule follower. So, I guess I'm
out from the game. But. I have for a long time an idea in my head. Create an
app, that will help me to track my monthly budgets and help to save and
eventually get more money.
Today it was busy day: 2.5h traveling time, 2h exam of
Computer Architecture by A. Mitasiunas, 8.5h work time, 1h home gym. I won't have
time to tweet about the progress each day, but I'll spend 1 hour each day for
this app, because it is great and will be awesome tool not just for me, but for
everybody. Eventually, I'll miss some days in logs as well. But at the end, most
important thing is to have fully working app live.
Front-end part will be open-sourced.

### Day 2: 2017-01-17

**Today's Progress**: Configured webpack, babel, added clientApp navBar react
components.

**Thoughts:** Well, it's seems that everything on front-end moves at the speed
of light. But it seems, it's not so hard to catch up.
Making ideas real it's not so easy task it seems, but challenge accepted and I
will continue on this project because it's fun and makes things different for me
and eventually for others too.
