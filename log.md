# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 2017-01-16

**Today's Progress**: Initial commit of my app.

**Thoughts:** I need to confess to you: I'm not a rule follower. So, I guess I'm
out from the game. But. I have for a long time an idea in my head. Create an
app, that will help me to track my monthly budgets and help to save and
eventually get more money.
Today it was busy day: 2.5h traveling time, 2h exam of
Computer Architecture by A. Mitasiunas, 8.5h work time, 1h home gym. I won't have
time to tweet about the progress each day, but I'll spend 1 hour each day for
this app, because it is great and will be awesome tool not just for me, but for
everybody. Eventually, I'll miss some days in logs as well. But at the end, most
important thing is to have fully working app live.
Front-end part will be open-sourced.

### Day 2: 2017-01-17

**Today's Progress**: Configured webpack, babel, added clientApp navBar react
components.

**Thoughts:** Well, it's seems that everything on front-end moves at the speed
of light. But it seems, it's not so hard to catch up.
Making ideas real it's not so easy task it seems, but challenge accepted and I
will continue on this project because it's fun and makes things different for me
and eventually for others too.

### Day 3: 2017-01-18

**Today's Progress**: Add all pages with initial mark-up, routes, navigation.

**Thoughts:** Now it's almost ready to have some useful stuff. React is really
great framework. And the whole eco-system is awesome. Webpack - great. One of
the hardest thing is how everything should look like, how every part should
interact with each other. Coding is not just writing code. It's a lot more to
it. I'm thinking to go for Django on back-end, not sure 100%, though. Will check
the web what it has to say more about back-end frameworks.

### Day 4: 2017-01-19

**Today's Progress**: Add jest and expenses.spec.js.

**Thoughts:** Today's discovery was jest, and relay.
I'm out of the game also because I won't share my backend where I have done some job
today. Designing your application is really a challenge. But I manage to
structure expenses data in database. I also switched to node.js in backend. Fun
stuff waits. And I can't wait what tomorrow will bring :)

### Day 5: 2017-01-20

**Today's Progress**: Add expenses table, new button, data file.

**Thoughts:** Yes, baby. It's getting shape now. Today I was more designer
rather then coder. Choosing the colors palette is real thing. For me it took
some time. But nice looking things is a must for me (suddenly I've realized
it). And yes, today I have 5% of 100 days finished :)
